### What is Vibe Coding?

> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."  
> — **Andrej Karpathy**, February 2025

Vibe coding is the practice of instructing AI to write code via natural language, accepting the output without deep review, and iterating rapidly based on the "vibe" or high-level intent.

## 5. 🎯 The Challenge: Build a To-Do App

Now that you've set up all three tools, it's time to build the **same application** using each one. This will allow you to compare the vibe coding experience across platforms.

### The Application Requirements

Build a simple **To-Do List Application** with the following features:

1. **Add a task** with a title
2. **Mark a task as complete**
3. **Delete a task**
4. **Display all tasks** in a list

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[To-Do App] --> B[Add Task]
    A --> C[Mark Complete]
    A --> D[Delete Task]
    A --> E[Display List]
```

### Your Prompts

Use the following prompts (or similar) with each tool:

**Initial Prompt:**
> "Create a simple to-do list application. Users should be able to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. Display all tasks in a clean list format."

**Refinement Prompts** (use as needed):
> "Add a checkbox next to each task to mark it complete"

> "Add a delete button for each task"

> "Make completed tasks appear with a strikethrough"

> "Add a count of remaining tasks at the bottom"

## 7. 🔧 Troubleshooting & Help

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't access Antigravity | May be region-restricted — try VPN or check availability |
| Bolt.new sign-in issues | Try an incognito window or switch between GitHub/Google login |
| Firebase console errors | Ensure you've enabled the correct APIs |
| AI not understanding prompts | Be more specific; break down into smaller requests |
| Generated code has bugs | Describe the bug to the AI and ask for a fix |

### Getting Help

- **Office Hours**: Ask questions during scheduled office hours
- **Moodle Forum**: Post questions for peer and instructor help
- **Documentation**: Each tool has official docs — read them!
- **Iterate**: If something doesn't work, try rephrasing your prompt

## 8. 🤖 Vibe Coding Best Practices

### The Vibe Coding Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1. Describe Goal] --> B[2. AI Generates Code]
    B --> C[3. Execute & Observe]
    C --> D{Works?}
    D -->|No| E[4. Refine Prompt]
    E --> B
    D -->|Yes| F[5. Deploy/Submit]
```

### Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Start with clear, high-level descriptions
- Iterate in small steps
- Test frequently
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Be specific when refining

**DON'T:**
- Accept code blindly for production use
- Ignore security considerations
- Skip testing because "it looks right"
- Forget to understand what the code does
- Use vibe coding for safety-critical applications

### Effective Prompting Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Add a red delete button on the right side of each task" is better than "add delete"
2. **Provide Context**: "This is for a mobile-first web app" helps the AI make appropriate choices
3. **Describe Behaviour**: Focus on what the app should DO, not how to code it
4. **Iterate Incrementally**: Add features one at a time rather than all at once

## 9. 🎓 Academic Integrity

### Remember

- **Vibe coding is about learning**, not just getting output
- **Understand what you submit** — you may be asked to explain your application
- **Document your process** — the journey is as important as the destination
- AI tools are **learning aids**, not replacements for understanding
- **Follow ATU's academic integrity policies** at all times

### What You're Learning

This lab teaches you to:
- Evaluate and compare AI development tools
- Think critically about AI-generated code
- Understand the trade-offs of different development approaches
- Develop skills in prompt engineering
- Reflect on the future of software development

### Comparison: Bolt.new vs Cursor

| Feature | Bolt.new | Cursor |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Type** | Browser-based | Desktop IDE |
| **Best For** | Quick prototypes, beginners | Serious development, learning |
| **Setup Time** | Instant (just visit website) | 5-10 mins (download + verify) |
| **Code Access** | View only (AI writes it) | Full control (you + AI together) |
| **Cost** | Free tier available | **Free for 1 year (students)** |
| **Deployment** | One-click Netlify | Manual (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) |

**Recommendation:** Try both! Use Bolt.new for rapid prototyping, and Cursor when you want more control and a deeper understanding of the code.
